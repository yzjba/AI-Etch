Cascade RNN for etching profile prediction

This is the implementation of the following paper:
Yao Z, Hu Z, Lai P, Qin F, Wang W, Wu Z, Wang L, Shao H, Li Y, Li Z, Liu Z. Etching process prediction based on cascade recurrent neural network. Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence. 2025 Jan 1;139:109590.

The following command will train the network and show some test results.
python main.py
